When creating user experiences (UX) for apps or websites, designers often follow a common process: starting with deep research, brainstorming ideas, testing these ideas, and finally designing the user interface. 

However, this traditional method often results in designs that aren't much different from existing apps, even though they might seem innovative at first.

## A New Approach: The Hybrid Model

What if we spend less time on the initial research and instead quickly create a prototype using a template that already exists? We can then watch how users interact with this prototype and learn directly from their experiences. 

This method, which I call the "Hybrid Model," could provide more detailed insights into what users really need and want.

## Pros and Cons of the Hybrid Model

**Pros:**

Quick Prototyping: Creating a basic version of the app quickly can reveal practical issues that theory alone might not show.

Real Feedback: Getting thoughts and opinions from actual users of a working app can be more accurate than guessing what they might like.

Saves Time and Money: Using existing tools and designs can be more efficient, especially for small companies or startups.

Less Bias: Seeing how users interact with a real app can provide more honest feedback than asking them hypothetical questions.

Continuous Improvement: This method lets designers make regular updates based on what users say, keeping the app fresh and relevant.

**Cons:**

Limits Creativity: Starting with a pre-made design might restrict new and innovative ideas.

Less Deep Research: Skipping early research might mean missing out on important user insights.

Resources for Prototyping: Even with a template, creating a prototype can still require significant resources, especially for complex features.

Constant Changes: Continuously updating the app based on feedback might prevent it from settling into a stable version.

Misinterpreting Feedback: Without solid initial research, user comments on the prototype might be misunderstood, leading to incorrect changes.

## When is the Hybrid Model Not Suitable?

For instance, in designing a specialized medical app that uses artificial intelligence (AI), this approach might not work well. 

Such a complex app requires intense accuracy, deep understanding of medical professionals' needs, and strict adherence to health regulations. These factors demand thorough research and careful development, which the hybrid model's quick cycles cannot provide.

## Deciding on the Right Approach

To decide which method to use, consider these four factors:

1. Problem Type: Is the issue common and well-understood, or is it new and complex?
2. User Familiarity: Do users already have a clear idea of what they need, or are they encountering something completely new?
3. Technical Difficulty: Is the technology simple and well-known, or is it cutting-edge and complicated?
4. Available Resources: Do you have enough time, money, and expertise for in-depth research and development, or are resources limited?

## Applying the Formula:

If the problem is common, users are familiar with it, the technology is simple, and resources are limited, the Hybrid Model works best.

If the problem is complex, users are new to it, the technology is advanced, and there are enough resources, a traditional, research-heavy approach is better.
