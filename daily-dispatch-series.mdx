New year, new beginnings 

Here are some excerpts from the book "Show your work" from Austin Kleon that inspired me today.

> “Put yourself, and your work, out there every day, and you’ll start meeting some amazing people.”—Bobby Solomon

> Once a day, after you’ve done your day’s work, go back to your documentation and find one little piece of your process that you can share

> If you’re in the very early stages, share your influences and what’s inspiring you. If you’re in the middle of executing a project, write about your methods or share works in progress. If you’ve just completed a project, show the final product, share scraps from the cutting-room floor, or write about what you learned.

> A daily dispatch is even better than a résumé or a portfolio, because it shows what we’re working on right now. When the artist Ze Frank was interviewing job candidates, he complained, “When I ask them to show me work, they show me things from school, or from another job, but I’m more interested in what they did last weekend.”

Starting today on my blog you'll see everything I'm working on. 

Here's the template I'm going to follow exactly based on Austin Kleon's recommendation -

## What are you working on? 


## What stage is it in? 


## What little piece of the process you can share?

At the end of each week I'll reflect on everything I learnt that week and share it on my weekly newsletter.

Subscibe if you already haven't :) 

See you on the other side!
