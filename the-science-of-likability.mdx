Today's post comprises reflections and a summary of a book I'm currently reading, titled "Like Switch: An Ex-FBI Agent's Guide to Influencing, Attracting, and Winning People Over."

For a long time, I considered the topic of likability somewhat taboo to think or talk about. "Why do you want to be liked?" "Why are you so needy?"

I believe everyone has a desire to be liked. The world becomes entirely different when you are liked. You have several friends, and as a result, you gain access to information and resources that would otherwise be hard to find.

For example, I found the home I live in (in Berlin, where the housing crisis is at its worst with less than 1% of available flats) because of a friend I made who happened to be the landlady of the shared apartment I was living in.

When I initially moved to Berlin, I would search for events and places online, but now, I discover almost every place I go to through friends.

On my birthday in May 2023, I brought together friends from 12 countries in a single bar, and it was an absolute blast

But I wasn't always like this. I had a small group of friends, and I would primarily hang out with them. Occasionally, I made new friends, but it was usually because of mutual benefit or shared interests.

My big discovery was you didn't always need a mutual benefit to make a good friend, or be liked. It can happen just through conversations. 

I had some hints about how this worked when I began playing improv. I observed which dialogues and scenes were more interesting than others. One key observation was that dialogues centered around emotions were more engaging than those focused on facts. 

In another book on improv comedy techniques, I learned that to make a scene watchable, it needs to have three elements: People, Experiences, and Situations. Despite this, when talking to a stranger, most of us tend to stick to neutral topics in an effort to get to know them, like their country of origin or their occupation.

While people may respond politely, this doesn't lead to friendship after a single interaction.

"The Like Switch" introduces a formula for friendship:

`Friendship = Proximity + Frequency + Duration + Intensity`

Proximity measures how close you are to the person you want to befriend. If you live in the same house with this person, the chances of becoming friends are the highest.

Duration is the length of your interactions, while frequency indicates how often you initiate interactions. There is an inverse relationship between duration and frequency; if you see a friend frequently, then the duration of each interaction tends to be shorter.

Intensity refers to how strongly you can satisfy another person's psychological and/or physical needs through the use of verbal and nonverbal behaviors.

When you have all four elements, you have the highest chance of making a friend. However, if you want to make a friend in the first interaction, you probably need to leverage two of the four variables: intensity and proximity.

The author, an FBI agent, provides an example of how he makes suspects admit to their crimes by befriending them. He would sit across from a suspect who swore not to speak a word and simply read his newspaper, thereby increasing the duration, proximity, and frequency variables of the friendship formula.

Naturally, after a while, the suspect gives in and starts talking.  

In another example, a couple may have proximity, frequency, and duration but lack intensity. They may spend a lot of time at home watching TV together, but they do not interact with any emotion. This relationship can be improved if the couple enhances the quality of their conversations by going on "date nights" to rekindle the feelings they have for each other.

If you are in a new city and want to make friends at a bar, here's a trick the author shares - 

Go to a bar and sit alone by yourself. Do this routinely and frequently, and display friendly signals like smiling. To increase the intensity, the author suggests using a "curiosity hook," such as doing something unusual, like arranging marbles on the table and observing them through a magnifying glass if marble collection is one of your interests. 

This would pique people's curiosity and make them come talk to you about it. It also helps to build good rapport with the bartender and servers because they would become your ambassadors to the members of the community.

## Empathic statement

How do you initiate a conversation with a stranger? You could do this in any number of ways, but empathetic statements are the most potent way to quickly build rapport.

Empathetic statements keep the focus of the conversation on the person you are talking to, rather than on yourself. They are one of the most effective ways to make people feel good about themselves.

An empathetic statement could look like this:

"You seem to be having a bad day" or "You look happy today," letting people know that someone is listening to them and cares about them.

To construct an empathetic statement, all you have to remember is the phrase "so you…"

"So you look excited about something"
"So you look like you're searching for something"

By saying this, you imply, "I understand how you feel." The other person then automatically thinks, "No, you don't know how I feel because you are not me." This shifts the conversation's focus to them and makes them feel good about themselves.

Here's another example from the book, a dialogue between Ben and Vicki: 

“BEN: Hi, my name is Ben. What’s yours?
VICKI: Hi, my name is Vicki.
BEN: You look like you’re really having fun tonight. (sophisticated empathic statement)
VICKI: I sure am. I really need a night out.
BEN: Then you’ve been really busy lately. (sophisticated empathic statement)”
VICKI: Yeah, I worked sixty hours a week for the lsat three weeks getting a project done. 

Ben constructed empathetic statements that reflected her emotional state. Ben achieved several things: first, he communicated to Vicki that he took an interest in her feelings; second, he focused the conversation on her; third, Vicki’s response gave Ben insights into which direction to steer the conversation.

Her response, “I sure am. I really need a night out,” indicates that Vicki had experienced some type of stress during the week or recently. Ben does not know the specific cause of her stress, but he can construct another empathetic statement to explore the reasons for her stress in a noninvasive way.

Vicki will not recognize that Ben is using a series of empathetic statements because this kind of behavior is perceived by the brain as "normal behavior" and doesn't arouse suspicion or a defensive reaction.
