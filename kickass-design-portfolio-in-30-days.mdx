## Struggling to Land a Design Job? You're Not Alone.

Thousands are applying, and the competition is fierce. It's tough, especially when you don't know why you're being rejected.

The Real Issue?

Bootcamps teach design, but miss the mark on real-world application. 

You learn principles, yet lack depth in understanding and applying them. The result? Portfolios that don't resonate with real-world needs.

### Hey, I'm Aswin üëãüèΩ

My journey took me through roles at Grab, Housing, and various startups. These experiences provided valuable learnings that I'm eager to share with you.
