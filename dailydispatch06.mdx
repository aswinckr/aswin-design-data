I ask myself this question every other day, and each time I do it I spend hours researching on -

## *How am I going to make money online*.

*Side note: I already made my first $10 on [Catchy Portfolios](https://designedbyaswin.gumroad.com/l/kickass-portfolio) before even completing it. A samaritan I don't know who he is, or how he found my product, bought this course. It got me super excited, but I refunded it anyway because I hadn't finished the course yet!*

So this time I wanted to make my plan clear along with my inspirations. 
	
There are tons of videos on How to make money on YouTube, and this time I happened to stumble upon a video from a creator I have never seen before, and it sparked an idea on how I can go about my plan. Here's the video in case you want to watch :

TLDR; There are 3 ways - 

1. Newsletter 
2. Productise your expertise
3. Website Templates

I'm sure you have heard of all 3, but this video touches on some questions I keep coming back to. 

*How will starting a new substack newsletter among tens of thousands others make me money?* 
*Who will buy my productised expertise?*

I know templates are easy to understand. You have to build first, and launch it on their store and hope for it to be found. Doing your own marketing increases your chances of it getting sold. 

## The newsletter way

Instead of starting a newsletter from scratch, the Jason Lee (the creator of the video), talks about solving problems and being a curator.

To start from 0 audience, he suggests getting active on Facebook groups and other communities, establish credibility by posting actively and plugging in your newsletter for them to find more information they are interested in. 

I don't have a newsletter yet, but I keep facing the dilemma of I should start a design newsletter, or one of the other topics I'm interested in.

I'll come back to this, but for now my newsletter is this - my daily dispatch. I'll be sharing my work in progress daily, but I'm aware that this hasn't been targeted to a specific audience yet. 

## Productise your expertise

This is the part I'm working on right now with [Catchy Portfolios](https://designedbyaswin.gumroad.com/l/kickass-portfolio)

I already have the expertise from working in design for a long time. I currently manage a team of designers at Deliveryhero. 

I've reviewed several portfolios in my role, and based on my observations, and some other inspirations, I'm creating this course to make portfolios that stand out.

But the big question is, how am I going to get my leads? 

I will soon read Alex Hormozi's 100M Leads to learn how to sell, but meanwhile there's another way to go about it.

Instead of selling the course right away, I could leave it at Pay-what-you-want model, and focus on building an audience. 

My initial distribution was to start writing more about this topic on LinkedIn, but the thought of it makes me uneasy. *What topic will I write about? How do I turn this course content into LinkedIn posts?* 

I'm yet to learn about this, but I need to learn this soon.

Alternatively, I could use what I have. I have a [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/designershipper) focused on design that I started a few years ago, and now has about 770 subscribers. 

I could, after I finish my Gumroad text based course, record YouTube videos of the same content and put the link to my Gumroad with some added benefit, like feedback and community for a cost. 

I could automatically add everyone who signs up on Gumroad into my Beehiv newsletter base (a better newsletter platform). I can do this [using Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/beehiiv/integrations/gumroad/1215226/create-subscribers-in-beehiiv-from-new-sales-in-gumroad) or an alternative.

Or I could just plug my newsletter on the first page in Gumroad, or send occasional emails to everyone who signed up on Gumroad to subscribe to my newsletter. 

The overall plan so far looks like this :

The other reason to use YouTube is because from analysing the topic demand on YouTube using VidIQ, it appears to be quite high. This video for example, has 196K views in the last 1 year.

## Questions going forward

While this is the tentative plan, there are several unanswered questions. 

- Is it better to just put a price to the course and sell it using ads?
- Is it better to put up micro content related to portfolios on YouTube, and lead them to purchase this course instead? 
- Is it better to write more articles on smaller topics related to portfolios, publish them on X or LinkedIn, and use that as a channel to drive traffic and lead towards a purchase? 
- Is there any other way I'm not seeing?
