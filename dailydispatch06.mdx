I ask myself this question every other day, and each time I do it I spend hours researching on -

## *How am I going to make money online*.

*Side note: I already made my first $10 on [Catchy Portfolios](https://designedbyaswin.gumroad.com/l/kickass-portfolio) before even completing it. A samaritan I don't know who he is, or how he found my product, bought this course. It got me super excited, but I refunded it anyway because I hadn't finished the course yet!*

So this time I wanted to make my plan clear along with my inspirations. 
	
There are tons of videos on How to make money on YouTube, and this time I happened to stumble upon a video from a creator I have never seen before, and it sparked an idea on how I can go about my plan. Here's the video in case you want to watch :

TLDR; There are 3 ways - 

1. Newsletter 
2. Productise your expertise
3. Website Templates

You might have heard of all 3, but this video touches on some questions I keep coming back to. 

1. *How will starting a new substack newsletter among tens of thousands others make me money?* 
2. *Who will buy my productised expertise?*

## The newsletter way

Instead of starting a newsletter from scratch, Jason Lee (the creator of the video), talks about solving problems and being a curator.

He suggests getting active on Facebook groups and other communities, establish credibility by posting actively and plugging in your newsletter for them to find more information they are interested in. 

I don't have a newsletter yet, but I keep facing the dilemma of I should start a newsletter in design, or one of the other topics I'm interested in.

I'll come back to this, but for now my newsletter is this - my daily dispatch. 

I'll be sharing my work in progress daily, but I'm aware that this hasn't been targeted to a specific audience yet. 

## Productise your expertise

I'm currently working on [Catchy Portfolios](https://designedbyaswin.gumroad.com/l/kickass-portfolio)

I already have the expertise from working in design for a long time, and currently manage a team of designers at Deliveryhero. 

I've reviewed several portfolios in my role, and based on my observations and some other inspirations, I'm creating this course to help designers make their portfolios stand out.

Here are some open questions I need to answer soon:

- *How do I bring leads to my course?* 
- *How do I turn my course content into LinkedIn Posts?* 
- *I already have a [Youtube Channel] with 770 subscribers (https://www.youtube.com/designershipper), what can I do with it?*
- *Should I charge my Gumroad course or keep it free to build an audience?*
- *Is it better to just put a price to the course and sell it using ads?*
- *Is it better to put up micro content related to portfolios on YouTube, and lead them to purchase this course instead?* 
- *Is it better to write more articles on smaller topics related to portfolios, publish them on X or LinkedIn, and use that as a channel to drive traffic and lead towards a purchase?* 
- *Is there any other way I'm not seeing?* 


Here's a tentative plan I made. Further revisions will follow :

## Other notes

- I could automatically add everyone who signs up on Gumroad into my Beehiv newsletter base (a better newsletter platform). I can do this [using Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/beehiiv/integrations/gumroad/1215226/create-subscribers-in-beehiiv-from-new-sales-in-gumroad) or an alternative.
- The topic of UX Portfolios has high search volume and low demand, hence might actually be a good way to generate leads (as analysed on VidIQ). Eg. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmgxspm9JWs) got about 196K views in the last 1 year.
