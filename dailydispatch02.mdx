- It's performance appraisal season and I'll be taking a 14 hour flight to India while finishing this. In addition to this I have The Like Switch and 100M Leads Audio book, a ton of newsletters on my Instapaper, and 4 movies of Pirates of The Caribbean downloaded on my Disney+. That's probably 50+ hours of work and content in queue
- Today I've been thinking about my content consumption.
