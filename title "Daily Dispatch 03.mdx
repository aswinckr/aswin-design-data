## Mathematics of weight loss 
I'm visiting India after almost 2 years to take care of my mother, who has been suffering from Sciatica lately, a pain that radiates along the path of the sciatic nerve, which branches from your lower back through your hips and buttocks and down each leg.

After visit to the doctor, I came to understand that like most other health concerns it could take up to 2-3 months time to heal. However there are still factors within our control that can expedite the healing process, and for my mom it's her weight. 

My mom has been struggling to lose weight for a while, and this area is something I could create results for myself because I was able to go from 83Kgs to 76kg, and get into a much better physical shape. 

So I took some experience and learnings on weight loss I could help my mom with. 

The doctors advice was - reduce carbs and fat. And increase protein.

Logically it makes sense as a direction of weight loss - lower calorie in, higher calorie out. 

However when I asked my mom about her food intake, she told me she has already cut down her calories. She eats maybe 1 chappati or 1-2 dosas. So why hasn't this helped her? 

Probing more into this I figured there are foods she eats without even realising. And a lot more of those foods that converts to carbs she doesn't even realise. For example, she drinks 4-5 glasses of buttermilk that she doesn't account for at all, she adds sugar and jaggery into her breakfast that are just empty calories. 

Reflecting on the habits that worked for me, the most effective (though not the most attractive) one was eating the same thing every day. I picked 3 of my favourite foods and just ate the same thing every day.

How did it help? I could see the trend of my weight and identify the impact. 

The formula goes like this 

`Food (Calorie In) - Exercise (Calorie Out) = Weight Trend(Upward or Downward)`

If `Food (Calorie In)` remains a constant throughout, and the weight trend stays the same over a period of 3-4 days, it likely means exercise isn't enough. 

If it's in downward trend, then you just have to adjust the intensity based on what works for you. 

Simple mathematics. 

It only takes discipline and will power to resist the temptation to eat variety of food everyday. This, is hard, but doable because she chose her favourite foods on the first place.

## Critical Reflections

In the last 3 years of living in Berlin alone, my character and views changed significantly. 

I practiced stream of consciousness writing for 2 years, and it helped me reflect on my behaviours and adjust where they didn't serve me.

For example, my parents brought me up, and I always saw myself as a polite person and would never offend anyone. And I often never realised they were overstepping my boundaries 

When an elderly shop owner who frequently visits my parents place for deliveries starts advising me on my personal life, I would calmly listen, and choose to ignore later (maybe occasionally take some advice)

However I would never argue or express disagreement because I would tell myself, what's the point of it? They are going to say what they want to say anyway. 

But I never realised that this was overstepping my boundaries. There were times when I forced myself to sit through uncomfortable advice that was forced on me and not utter a word. 

I learnt to recognise and change that. 

Instead, I interrupted him in the middle of his monologue, and told him, "I understand what you are saying, and thankyou for that, but I have a different way of thinking through this. I don't want to get into the specifics because it will turn into a long conversation."

This was a much better response because I was honest. Not to him, but to myself. I acted in congruence to how I felt. This was practicing vulnerability, that Berene brown quotes in her book "Power of vulnerability". 


## Living on the edge 

I watched an interesting podcast with Morgen House and Tim Ferris. Watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQb76J9-HY&t=4291s)

He talks about the idea of living on the edge - to push yourself and be in a position of slight discomfort so you are challenged and keeps you growing, but not too much that you burn out.  

This idea resonates with me in different places - last extra rep to failure when lifting weights, cold showers, facing fears head on and doing something that makes you uncomfortable, and so on.

I thought this idea fit well for my mom because it was hard for me to tell if she avoided exercise on the first place because of mild discomfort, or if it was unbearable pain.
