## Mathematics of weight loss 
I'm in India today after almost 2 years, looking after my mother. She's been dealing with Sciatica, a pain that shoots along the sciatic nerve from the lower back through the hips and buttocks down each leg.

After visiting the doctor, I learned that, like many health issues, it might take 2-3 months to heal. However, there are still things we can do to speed up the healing process, and for my mom, it's her weight.

My mom has been facing challenges in losing weight for a while, and this is an area where I've personally achieved results. I managed to go from 83 kgs to 76 kgs and significantly improve my physical shape.

With my own experience and lessons learned, I have insights that I can apply to help my mom achieve positive results.

The doctor's recommendation was to eliminate carbs and fats while boosting protein intake.

Logically, it makes sense as a path to weight loss—reducing calorie intake and increasing calorie expenditure.

However, when I inquired about my mom's food intake, she mentioned she had already reduced her calories. She typically consumes just one chapati or 1-2 dosas. So, why hasn't this led to any improvement?

Digging deeper into this, I discovered there are foods she consumes without even realising it. There are also many foods that covert to carbs which she isn't aware of. For instance, she drinks 4-5 glasses of buttermilk without accounting for them at all. Additionally, she adds sugar and jaggery to her breakfast, which are essentially empty calories.

Reflecting on the habits that worked for me, the most effective (although not the most exciting) one was sticking to a routine of eating the same thing every day. I chose three of my favourite foods and stuck with that daily routine.

How did it help? It allowed me to observe a clear trend in my weight and identify the impact of my food choices.

The formula goes like this :

`Food (Calorie In) - Exercise (Calorie Out) = Weight Trend(Upward or Downward)`

If the "Food (Calorie In)" remains constant, and the weight trend stays consistent over a period of 3-4 days, it likely indicates that the amount of exercise  isn't sufficient.

If there's a downward trend, then you just need to adjust the intensity based on what works for you.

Simple math. 

It only takes discipline and willpower to resist the temptation of eating a variety of foods every day. It's challenging, but achievable, especially since she initially chose her favorite foods.

## Critical Reflections

In the last 3 years of living alone in Berlin, my character has undergone significant changes and evolution. I engaged in a lot of stream-of-consciousness writing to reflect on my thinking, leading to substantial modifications in behaviors that didn't serve me well.

For instance, having been brought up by my parents, I always considered myself a polite person who would never intentionally offend anyone. However, through reflection, I came to the realization that I often failed to recognize when others were overstepping my boundaries.

When an elderly shop owner, who often visits my parents' place for deliveries, starts offering advice on my personal life, I would calmly listen and then choose to ignore it later, occasionally considering some of the advice.

I would never argue or express disagreement because I would tell myself, "What's the point? They are going to say what they want to say anyway." 

But I never realized that this was overstepping my boundaries. There were times when I forced myself to sit through uncomfortable advice that was imposed on me and chose not to say a word. 

I learned to recognize and change that.

Instead, I interrupted him in the middle of his monologue and said, "I understand what you are saying, and thank you for that, but I have a different way of thinking through this. I don't want to get into the specifics because it will turn into a long conversation."

This was a much better response because I was honest, not just to him but to myself. I acted in congruence with how I felt. This was practicing vulnerability, as Brené Brown mentions in her book "The Power of Vulnerability."

## Living on the edge 

I came across this idea on a podcast, I believe with Morgan Housel.

It should be somewhere in this video, I think. Nevertheless, it's a great watch - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQb76J9-HY&t=4291s

The idea is to live on the edge — to push yourself and be in a position of slight discomfort so that you are challenged and keep growing, but not too much that it tires you out completely. 

This idea strongly resonates with me in various contexts — the last extra rep to failure when lifting weights, taking cold showers, facing fears head-on, and doing things that make you uncomfortable, and so on.

Today, I was explaining this idea to my mother, who completely skips exercise because it's painful, and it's challenging for me to gauge the extent of her pain.

I believe that if she pushes herself, even just a little bit, despite the pain, she would be training her muscles and making them stronger.
