## What are you working on? 
- I'm flying across Frankfurt to Delhi while curating my content diet. I find myself pulled into several different kinds of content almost always no control over where my attention goes. It only leaves me with a feeling of overwhelm with the number of things I need to know, while my goals ultimately still remain the same. 


Here's a suggestion from Dan Koe on how to deepen your on a specific domain : 

> For the next month, immerse yourself in an echo chamber of your interests. This is how you condition yourself in a positive way and gain awareness of that domain fast.
