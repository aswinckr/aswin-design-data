## What are you working on? 
A week ago, I wrote about Alex Hormozi's book, "100m offers", and discussed how it's a valuable tool for designers. [Read the article here](/alex-hormozi-100m-offers-to-solve-design-problems)

I'm creating a course called [Catchy Portfolios](https://designedbyaswin.gumroad.com/l/kickass-portfolio) based on the concepts in this book.

To illustrate the concepts in the course in practice, I thought it would be a fun idea to design an app I've been contemplating for a while - AI Coaching.

About AI Coaching : 

### Key Problem
Individuals striving to achieve personal and professional goals often face the challenge of maintaining consistency, focus, and accountability. Busy schedules, lack of motivation, and the absence of a structured support system can lead to procrastination, feelings of isolation, and ultimately hinder their progress.

### Who does it impact
The bemycoach.ai app is designed to cater to working professionals aged 25-45 who are juggling career ambitions, personal growth, and well-being. This demographic often struggles with maintaining work-life balance, setting and achieving goals, and staying motivated in the face of challenges. Our solution is tailored to address the unique needs of this segment, providing a personalized coaching experience.

### Describe your solution
- [bemycoach.ai](http://bemycoach.ai/) is a goal-oriented coaching and accountability app that leverages artificial intelligence to empower users in their journey towards personal and professional success. Through personalized coaching plans, users can set specific goals, whether related to career advancement, health and fitness, or personal development. The app offers features like progress tracking, habit formation, and real-time feedback to keep users on track.
- Our AI-powered virtual coach provides personalized insights, motivation, and guidance based on user inputs, progress data, and behavioral patterns.

### Success Metric
Success for bemycoach.ai will be measured through a combination of quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of the app's impact.

- **Primary Metric:**
The key success metric will be the sustained achievement of user-set goals. Tracking the number of completed goals, adherence to coaching plans, and positive changes in user habits will be crucial indicators of the app's effectiveness in facilitating real-life improvements for our users.
- **User Engagement:**
Successful engagement will be reflected in metrics such as active daily/weekly users, frequency and duration of app usage, and the number of interactions with the virtual coach. Increased engagement signifies that users find value in the coaching experience, maintaining their commitment to personal and professional development.

## Why do I want to build an AI Coach? 

In the last 2 years, having a coach has had a tremendous impact in my life. 

My fitness coach helped me with accountability and eliminated the uncertainty of "will this work or not", turning it into a repeatable process I could follow that yielded results in just a few weeks. 

I enrolled in a writing group that has accountability mechanics inbuilt, similar to a coach. This approach helped me write consistently for 30 days and influenced my interest in writing.

Without any accountability system I find myself easily distracted with the next shiny thing, preventing me from completing any project I start.  

Building in public, consistently turning up everyday, breaking down the goal, and creating an exhaustive list of problems are the key concepts that worked for me. These are the ideas I plan to incorporate into the platform I want to design within catchy portfolios. 

Later, I also plan to build the entire thing by myself using NextJS.
