In 2024, I've set a big goal for myself - to write 1,000 words every single day for the entire year. But why am I doing this? Let me tell you about my journey and why I've chosen to take on this writing challenge.

Back in early 2023, I tried something interesting. I wrote every day for 30 days, and the results were quite amazing. It wasn't just about putting words on paper; it was a journey of discovery:

During those 30 days, I found that writing helped me think more clearly. It became my special time for thinking deeply about my ideas. It wasn't about writing to share polished pieces with others; it was more about personal reflection and thinking.

Surprisingly, my writing resonated with some people. For instance, I met a German diplomat on a plane to Barcelona, and we became friends because he read my articles on my website.

What I wrote about also became the main topic of my conversations, and this led to meaningful connections with people who shared similar interests. Writing not only clarified my thoughts but also helped me find like-minded individuals.

Another interesting thing that happened was that I became more sociable when I wrote. I wanted to talk about these ideas with the people I interacted with. It was during these conversations that my ideas became even clearer, and I often found myself surprised by the insights I gained.

As I continued to write, I became more curious about specific topics. Without writing, I found myself just consuming random information that didn't really benefit me. Writing gave me a purpose - I was learning so I could discuss it with others the next day.

I drew inspiration from people like Nathan Barry, who emphasized that you don't have to be an expert to help others. Sharing your stories and experiences is just as important.

Similarly, Ali Abdaal's YouTube channel had a significant impact on one of his subscribers, who said that Ali's content made him more productive. It's amazing how content creators can positively influence others, much like how entrepreneurs build businesses.

Despite my initial fear of sharing something too basic, I learned through the Ship30 program that I could overcome this fear and deepen my writing. Growth happens when you push past the fear of what others might think.

Originally, my goal with writing was to make money. I have skills in software development and problem-solving through design, but I couldn't find the right audience to offer my solutions. So, I decided to start with writing. I began by curating valuable information for others. My plan was to build an audience, and eventually provide solutions through information products or software. This plan remains the same, and in 2024, I'm excited to share my journey and the lessons I learn along the way.

Starting today, I'm expanding my writing journey to include video content. Here's how it works: I spend an hour or two each day writing 1,000 words on different topics. Once I've written those words, I outline a video where I explain my thoughts on camera. It's a way to make the process more enjoyable and less cumbersome, especially since I'm not a fan of editing written content.

In today's world, information is everywhere, but it's often disorganized and impersonal. What makes content stand out are the stories. Stories help us connect with the message and think for ourselves. Every writer has a unique story to tell, even if the main message is similar.

In my case, I'll be focusing my writing on specific topics like design, persuasion, and storytelling. Why these subjects? Simply because I'm passionate about them, and I genuinely believe that mastering these skills will not only make me a better writer but also a better communicator and a more well-rounded person.

Ultimately, my goal is to connect with people who resonate with my content. If you find my approach interesting, I'd be happy to help you get started on a similar journey. If there are other topics you find interesting in my writing, I'm open to discussing and exploring ideas together. Some of the topics I'm thinking about include the evolution of the creator economy, community building, and skills in design, persuasion, and storytelling.
