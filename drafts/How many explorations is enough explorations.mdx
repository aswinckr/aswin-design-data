# How many explorations is enough explorations

Today I was on a call with Chris where he was at the final stages of review of quantity stepper on Cart

I can tell he was getting a bit impatient because he wanted to launch and release this fast. This is understandable

But after it went through RPL solution review, it got way more feedback so he had to go back to the drawing board

And then we had opinions so it led him to create more iterations on top of it. 

So what now? How many iterations should he create? 

Same with Charu's Pandora island. 

She made several iterations and was getting a bit impatient as she wanted to finish this project before taking up the next one

She again got multiple feedback in RPL review that led her to create further explorations. Now she's back in the drawing board creating further tweaks

How much is enough? Is there a standard practice for this?
